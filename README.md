# 🔠 Next.js Typing Speed Test

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The application helps users practice typing speed and accuracy while tracking key metrics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to start typing!

## 🎯 Features (To-Do)

- ⏳ **Timer**: Set duration (1min, 2min) for the test.
- 🏃 **WPM Calculation**: Measure words per minute accurately.
- ❌ **Error Tracking**: Identify keys pressed incorrectly most frequently.
- 📜 **Varied Content**: Multiple paragraphs based on difficulty levels.
- 📜 **Scrolling Text**: Implement auto-scrolling after completing a paragraph.
- 🔑 **User Authentication**: Login/Signup functionality for tracking progress.

## 🐞 Known Bugs

- ❌ **First Key Issue**: Incorrect keypress not registering initially (Potential Fix: Require ENTER to start test, but ENTER registers as first key).
- 🔲 **Space Key Issue**: Spacebar not functioning correctly during typing test.

## ✅ Completed Fixes

- ⏬ **Negative Timer**: Timer no longer goes below zero.
- 🔍 **Cursor Positioning**: Cursor now accurately shows user progress.
- 🔙 **Backspace Handling**: Allows users to correct mistakes efficiently.
