This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To-Do Features:
* Timer - 1min, 2min
* WPM - formulate words per minute
* Which keys are pressed wrong maximun number of times
* Multiple paragraphs based on dificulty
* Implementation of scrolling text after a para is over
* User Login/Signup


Bugs:
* Not showing wrong on first press, shows correct (Although I can say to press ENTER to start in such case it registers ENTER as first key and works fine)
* Space not working


Done:
* Timer going negative
* Cursor to show where user is
* Backspace to correct mistakes
